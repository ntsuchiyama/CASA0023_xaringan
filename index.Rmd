# Reflections

I found the application of the data for a EU-wide policy  interesting. The exploration of outer space onsidering the notion of space nationalism. The whole operation of Sentinel 2 in the first place may be thought of a representation of "Europeanisation"
Europeanisation of 

A better understanding of how the sensor operates for a more sophisticated interpretation of the data that is produced by the sensor.
