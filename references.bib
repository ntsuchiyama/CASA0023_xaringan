	abstract = {The importance of lakes and reservoirs leads to the high need for monitoring lake water quality both at local and global scales. The aim of the study was to test suitability of Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imager’s (MSI) data for mapping different lake water quality parameters. In situ data of chlorophyll a (Chl a), water color, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from nine small and two large lakes were compared with band ratio algorithms derived from Sentinel-2 Level-1C and atmospherically corrected (Sen2cor) Level-2A images. The height of the 705 nm peak was used for estimating Chl a. The suitability of the commonly used green to red band ratio was tested for estimating the CDOM, DOC and water color. Concurrent reﬂectance measurements were not available. Therefore, we were not able to validate the performance of Sen2cor atmospheric correction available in the Sentinel-2 Toolbox. The shape and magnitude of water reﬂectance were consistent with our ﬁeld measurements from previous years. However, the atmospheric correction reduced the correlation between the band ratio algorithms and water quality parameters indicating the need in better atmospheric correction. We were able to show that there is good correlation between band ratio algorithms calculated from Sentinel-2 MSI data and lake water parameters like Chl a (R2 = 0.83), CDOM (R2 = 0.72) and DOC (R2 = 0.92) concentrations as well as water color (R2 = 0.52). The in situ dataset was limited in number, but covered a reasonably wide range of optical water properties. These preliminary results allow us to assume that Sentinel-2 will be a valuable tool for lake monitoring and research, especially taking into account that the data will be available routinely for many years, the imagery will be frequent, and free of charge.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the ﬁelds of political economy and economic sociology have seen the emergence of research focussed on the ‘political work’ of industries: industrial products can embed domestic policies and feelings of national belonging. This article analyses the way in which space industries materialise national expression among European states as examples of the tensions between Europeanisation and nationalism. Three roles that are endorsed by space industries are discussed. First, space industries act as a support to an idealtype of Europe, shared by the two institutional frames of European space policy: the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Union (EU). Second, while the ESA and the EU maintain relationships characterised alternately by independency, division of labour, or competition, this bicephalic framework leads to the deployment of a European claim to sovereignty and autonomy on the international stage. Third, space industries aﬃliated with an ESA member state can also be turned into instruments of national leadership at the expense of European unity. While space industries remain overlooked in the literature on European policies, emphasising industries illustrates that ‘unity in diversity’, claimed in the will of Europeanisation by European institutions, reinvents itself through an industrial sector where nationalist strategies remain strong.},
